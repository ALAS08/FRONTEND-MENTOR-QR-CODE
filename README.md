## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

It's my first real project and I'll admit that even though the design looks simple, I have a hard time creating it using html and css. But as a beginner, It makes me happy that I've been able to create it, although it's not that perfect but this is my first time and I'm sure that I'll improve as I keep learning.

### Useful resources

- (https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me for codes and terms I'm not familiar. I'll keep going back to it when I don't understand something about my code.
